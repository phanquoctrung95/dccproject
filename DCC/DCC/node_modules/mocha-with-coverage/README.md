# mocha-with-coverage

> Run [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) tests with [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) coverage but include non-tested files.

Istanbul does not have built-in support to show non-tested files (see [this issue](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/issues/112)). [gulp-istanbul](https://github.com/SBoudrias/gulp-istanbul) provides this functionality, but setting this up in every project can become tedious.

This module helps you set this up quickly:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mocha-with-coverage
./node_modules/.bin/mocha-with-coverage \
  --istanbul.includeUntested \
  --mocha.require test/setup.js \
  --mocha.timeout 2500 \
  --sources src/**/*.js \
  --tests test/**/*.spec.js
```

Currently four reports are generated: `json`, `lcovonly`, `html` and `cobertura` in `reports/coverage/json`, `reports/coverage/lcovonly`, `reports/coverage/html` and `reports/coverage/cobertura`, respectively. If you need this to be configurable, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Finanzchef24-GmbH/mocha-with-coverage/issues).
